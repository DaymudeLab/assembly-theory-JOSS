# Summary

TODO: Abstract.



# Statement of Need

TODO: Why is the software necessary?



# Formatting Considerations

$\LaTeX$ formatting works as usual, with single dollar signs for inline math, double dollar signs for self-standing equations, and begin-end equation environments for labeled equations.

Citations look like this:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
